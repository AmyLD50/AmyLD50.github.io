            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Amy! I'm 19 years old, and as a trans woman navigating the world of technology, I've found my
                place in Computer Information Systems, focusing on cybersecurity. From a young age, I was fascinated by
                how things worked behind the screen. I remember picking up my first programming book, a guide to
                JavaScript, and realizing that this was something I truly loved. This passion led me to delve into
                backend development with Node.js, where I learned how to create server-side applications and APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I grew, my curiosity only deepened. Computers became more than just machines; they were canvases for
                creativity and problem-solving. Today, I’m channeling that curiosity into a formal education in
                cybersecurity. I’m exploring the fascinating—and sometimes dangerous—world of digital security, aiming
                to understand vulnerabilities and protect information. My path has also taken a creative turn, as I'm
                now working on a game with friends, merging my love for tech with storytelling, music, and more.
